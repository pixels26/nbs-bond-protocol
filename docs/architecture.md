## Cross-Contract Calls

```
ProjectRegistry ──► BondIssuer (verify project exists)
BondIssuer ──► CouponEngine (distribute coupons)
CouponEngine ──► OracleConsumer (read verified reports by report_id)
DEXRouter ──► BondIssuer (settle purchase via transfer, debiting seller / crediting buyer)
CreditRetirement ──► CouponEngine (verify credit ownership, read PeriodInfo for the vintage window)
CreditRetirement ──► BondIssuer (verify holding, validate the caller's project_id)
```

## Bond Maturity

- A bond matures when the ledger timestamp reaches its `maturity_date` — `mature_bond` rejects calls made before that instant (`BondError::Overflow`).
- Once the maturity date elapses, `subscribe` and `transfer` are rejected even if the bond has not yet been admin-matured, so the bond's outstanding supply is frozen on schedule.
- `redeem` still requires the explicit `Matured` state, keeping redemption a deliberate admin-acknowledged step.

## Marketplace Settlement

- Buyers must first `deposit_quote` a quote asset (e.g. USDC) into the DEXRouter; purchases otherwise fail with `DEXError::InsufficientFunds`.
- `execute_purchase` atomically transfers bond tokens (`BondIssuer.transfer`) and escrowed quote (`price_per_token * amount`) from buyer to seller, so a fill either fully settles or fully reverts.
- Sellers can `withdraw_quote` their proceeds; `get_quote_balance` reports escrowed balances by symbol.

## Coupon Integrity

- `CouponEngine.distribute_coupon` accepts an **on-chain `report_id`** instead of a caller-supplied report, eliminating fabricated distributions.
- It reads the report from the `OracleConsumer` contract and rejects any report whose status is not `Verified` (`ReportNotVerified`).
- The report's `project_id` must match the bond's registered project, otherwise distribution is rejected.
- The verified report id is persisted in `PeriodInfo`, making every distribution auditable back to its evidence.
- Integer-division remainder that cannot be allocated to holders is recorded as `undistributed` per period and aggregated in `UndistributedTotal`; the admin can recover it via `sweep_undistributed`, preventing value from being silently lost.

## Retirement Certificates

- `retire_credits` takes the `project_id` and `period_index` from the caller and validates both on-chain: the project against `BondIssuer.get_bond`, the period against `CouponEngine.get_period_info`.
- The certificate caches `report_id`, `vintage_year`, and the monitoring window (`vintage_period_start` / `vintage_period_end`) at retirement time, so reads never re-derive the vintage from the oracle.
- Certificates are keyed in persistent storage and indexed by `(bond_id, holder)`; `extend_retirement_ttl` is permissionless so any relying party can keep a certificate alive.
- See [retirement-certificates.md](retirement-certificates.md) for the certificate schema, the design trade-offs, and the caller migration note.
